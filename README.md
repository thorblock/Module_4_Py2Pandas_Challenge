# Module_4_Py2_Challenge
Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. Analysis of school and standardized test dats is maintained through the use and manipulation of pandas dataframes. Jupyter blocks are broken up by my own thinking process, if you want individual numbers let me know.

## PyCity School Analysis notes
The folder PyCitySchools contains a resource folder with the starting CSV files and a Jupyter Notebook. The written report portion can be found at the top of the Jupyter notebook.
