    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "Analysis of Means\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary assessment in the PyCitySchool notebook is the per_school_summary table. This table represents the overarching scale of schools within the school district. Percent Passing columns are our critical performance indicators for each school. Additionally, the spending_summary, size_summary, and type_summary are additive to change our view to a specific perspective. Those perspectives are excellent since they remove other factors that might pull away from a desired perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first conclusion draws on analyzing our overall worst-performing and best-performing schools. The top-performing schools are all charter schools. There could be many reasons for this, but the instance represented with this current data set is the total number of students per school. Using the School Size table, we can surmise that larger school populations lead to lower scores; we reinforce this notion in the bottom_schools table, where, compared to top-performing schools, the total number of students is much larger. That goes hand-in-hand with charter versus public schools; charter schools often cap the number of students; smaller class sizes or cohorts lead to less strained instructor interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "My second conclusion draws from the spending Ranges (Per Student) summary. In this perspective, money is not a direct factor in the score effect. Instead, it is students who have less money to spend that are performing the best. That feeds into the psychological premise that limitation forces creativity; with less around, students need to be creative in their approach to learning. Constraints help define scope, which helps achieve an overall goal.\n",
